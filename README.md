# Linux Task Scheduler Project


Project Introduction: Task Scheduler using Bash

The Task Scheduler using Bash  is a Linux-based automation tool designed to help users schedule and manage their system tasks through a simple graphical interface. Built using **Bash scripting** and enhanced with **Zenity** for GUI components, this project simplifies routine administrative and user-defined operations on Linux systems.

In many Linux environments, system administrators and users rely on manual command-line operations or complex cron jobs for task scheduling. This project aims to bridge the gap by offering a **menu-driven, user-friendly interface** that allows users to perform essential scheduling tasks like:

* Adding tasks with specific time and date
* Listing all scheduled tasks
* Editing or deleting tasks
* Viewing task execution logs

The scheduler works by internally using tools like `cron`, `at`, and `crontab`, while Zenity provides dialog boxes for interaction. It ensures that even users with minimal command-line experience can interact with the system efficiently.

This project not only demonstrates automation using Bash scripting but also showcases how graphical elements can be combined with shell scripts to create powerful system utilities. It is especially useful for educational purposes, system administration training, or small-scale task management needs in Linux-based environments.
